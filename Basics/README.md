# Basics of Langchain: LLM version of Hello World
This folder provides the basic hello world implementations to major concepts of LLMs with LangChain.
This will be continued upon each new concept learned during the journey from zero to hero.

1. `hello_chat_model`: Provides a basic model initialization along with system prompt and query
2. `hello_few_shot_prompting`: Provides first usage of few shot prompts through Python and LangChain libraries. Structure can be used for similar prompting.
3. `hello_prompting`: Provides first usage of simple prompts through Python and LangChain libraries
4. `hello_rag`: Provides a basic RAG template and implements RAG on PDF. Modular structure can be used as base and repeated with this structure.
5. `hello_world_2`: Provides a basic model initialization and prompting from Python code - but plays around with temperature i.e. creativity of the LLM
6. `hello_world_3`: Provides basic model init (but directly through langchain-model instantiation)
7. `hello_world`: Provides a basic model initialization and prompting from Python code.
