    "    * From 30k to 132k apps built by LangChain.\n",
    "* Some of the latest popular LangChain projects:\n",
    "    * AI Agent for Coding at Replit.\n",
    "    * AI Agent for Customer Support at L’Oréal.\n",

    "    * The ecosystem has stabilized. LLM applications are no longer being built solely in hackathons — they are being shipped to production.\n",
    "    * The ecosystem has exploded. When langchain first launched, there were approximately 3 LLM providers. Today, there are over 70 model providers, along with countless integrations (document loaders, vector stores, and more) - totaling over 700 different integrations in langchain.\n",
    "    * The ecosystem has matured. **The focus has shifted from simply building a prototype to making their LLM app production-ready**.\n",
    "        * **\"Easy to get started\" does not equal to \"easy to get to production\"**."

    "## LangGraph: Agent control with flexible orchestration\n",
    "* As we collaborated with talented builders, startups, and enterprises, another challenge emerged. It became clear that higher-level, prebuilt constructs in LangChain weren't enough for production use cases. We kept hearing that off-the-shelf chains were too rigid, and **pre-configured agents lacked the reliability developers needed at scale**.\n",
    "* We realized that in order to increase the reliability, **developers needed more control** over the cognitive architectures of their applications.\n",
    "* Inspired by all the feedback, we built LangGraph — a flexible orchestration framework that lets developers build agents across a spectrum of autonomy, from precisely-defined workflows to more autonomous, adaptive agents.\n",
    "* LangGraph provides a **flexible architecture for users to customize their agents to their individual or business needs**.\n",
    "* With human-in-the-loop support and moderation loops, a LangGraph user has more control over their agent's behavior to ensure reliable outputs.\n",
    "* We've seen exciting use cases built on LangGraph — from Replit’s coding agent to [Unify’s sales agent.](https://blog.langchain.dev/unify-launches-agents-for-account-qualification-using-langgraph-and-langsmith/)"
